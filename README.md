# Menu management particle with hover effect for [Gantry] 5 Framework. 

A job see on tympanus.net (Codrops) by Mary Lou about some menu link hover effects for your inspiration (Powered by CSS and JavaScript for individual letter animations) gave me idea of this particle. I have added also a Simple menu option.
